# REPO_ANALYZE_ERROR (repo-003)

## Error Description

This error occurs when Cursor Utils encounters an issue while analyzing a repository. Repository analysis problems can happen when processing repository contents, extracting information, or generating insights from the repository structure or code.

## Example Error

```
Ã— ERROR: Failed to analyze repository
  Code: repo-003
  
  Causes:
  - Error processing repository files
  - Analysis timeout due to repository complexity
  - Insufficient memory for analysis
  - Unsupported file types or structures
  - API service error during analysis
  
  Suggestion: Try with a simpler repository or focus on specific subdirectories
  
  For more information: https://gweidart.github.io/cursor-utils/errors/repo-003.md
```

## Common Causes

1. **Processing Errors**: Issues encountered when processing repository files.
2. **Repository Complexity**: The repository is too complex or large for effective analysis.
3. **Resource Limitations**: Insufficient memory or CPU resources for the analysis.
4. **Unsupported Content**: The repository contains file types or structures that aren't supported.
5. **API Service Issues**: Problems with the underlying AI service used for repository analysis.
6. **Timeout**: The analysis took too long and timed out.

## Solutions

### Limit analysis scope

Focus the analysis on a specific part of the repository:

```bash
cursor-utils repo https://github.com/username/repo-name --subdir src/
```

### Filter by file type

Analyze only specific file types:

```bash
cursor-utils repo https://github.com/username/repo-name --include "*.py,*.md" --exclude "*.json,*.yaml"
```

### Use a simpler repository

Try with a smaller or less complex repository:

```bash
cursor-utils repo https://github.com/username/simpler-repo
```

### Increase timeout

Allow more time for the analysis:

```bash
cursor-utils repo https://github.com/username/repo-name --timeout 300
```

### Check API key

Ensure your API key for the analysis service is valid:

```bash
cursor-utils config api_keys --type GEMINI
```

### Update Cursor Utils

Make sure you're using the latest version:

```bash
cursor-utils update
```

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Check analysis logs

Review the analysis logs for specific error information:

```bash
cat ~/.cursor-utils/logs/cursor-utils.log
```

### Run with debug mode

Enable debug mode for more detailed logging:

```bash
cursor-utils repo https://github.com/username/repo-name --debug
```

### Check repository structure

Examine the repository structure for potential issues:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name

# Check directory structure
find . -type d | sort

# Count files by type
find . -type f | grep -v "^./.git/" | rev | cut -d. -f1 | rev | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### Verify file encodings

Check if the repository contains files with problematic encodings:

```bash
# Find non-UTF-8 text files
find . -type f -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.md" | xargs -I{} bash -c "file {} | grep -v 'UTF-8'"
```

### Analyze in smaller chunks

Break down the analysis into smaller pieces:

```bash
# Analyze subdirectories individually
for dir in $(find . -maxdepth 1 -type d | grep -v "^\./\."); do
  cursor-utils repo https://github.com/username/repo-name --subdir $dir
done
```

## Analysis Limitations

Cursor Utils has the following limitations for repository analysis:

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| File types | Some binary or proprietary file formats may not be analyzed properly |
| Language support | Some programming languages may have better support than others |
| Repository structure | Unusual or non-standard repository structures may cause issues |
| Nested dependencies | Deep dependency trees might not be fully analyzed |
| Analysis depth | There may be limits to how deeply code relationships are analyzed |

## Optimization Strategies

To optimize repository analysis:

### File Selection

- Focus on important code files
- Exclude generated code, tests, and documentation if not needed
- Prioritize key modules or components

### Structure Simplification

- Use standard repository layouts
- Keep directory nesting to a reasonable depth
- Follow conventional code organization patterns

### Query Targeting

- Ask specific questions about particular components
- Break complex analysis tasks into simpler ones
- Focus on one language or framework at a time
