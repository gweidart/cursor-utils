```

## Common Causes

1. **Unexpected Errors**: Errors that weren't anticipated in the error handling logic.
2. **System Interruptions**: The update process was interrupted unexpectedly (e.g., power loss, system crash).
3. **Resource Limitations**: Unexpected resource constraints (memory, CPU, disk, etc.).
4. **Environment Inconsistencies**: Unusual system environment configurations.
5. **Software Bugs**: Bugs in the update code itself.
6. **Corrupted State**: The installation is in a corrupted or unexpected state.

## Solutions

### Check the logs

Examine the logs for more detailed information about the error:

```bash
cat ~/.cursor-utils/logs/cursor-utils.log
cat ~/.cursor-utils/logs/update.log
```

Look for specific error messages, stack traces, or exception information that might provide more context about the unknown error.

### Run with debug mode

Run the update with debug logging enabled:

```bash
cursor-utils update --debug
```

This will produce much more detailed logs that can help identify the issue.

### Clean installation

Try a complete reinstallation:

```bash
# Remove existing installation
pip uninstall -y cursor-utils
rm -rf ~/.cursor-utils  # Be careful with rm -rf commands!

# Reinstall
pip install cursor-utils
cursor-utils install
```

### Try updating to a specific version

If the problem is with the latest version, try updating to a known stable version:

```bash
cursor-utils update --version X.Y.Z
```

### Check system resources

Ensure your system has adequate resources:

```bash
# Check disk space
df -h

# Check memory (Linux)
free -h

# Check memory (Windows PowerShell)
Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object FreePhysicalMemory, TotalVisibleMemorySize
```

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Temporary workarounds

While you're troubleshooting the unknown error, you might want to use alternative approaches:

1. **Manual Installation**: Clone and install from source
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gweidart/cursor-utils.git
   cd cursor-utils
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Offline Installation**: If network issues are suspected
   ```bash
   # Download the package on a working machine
   pip download cursor-utils -d ./packages
   
   # Copy ./packages to the target machine and install
   pip install --no-index --find-links ./packages cursor-utils
   ```

3. **Component-Specific Updates**: Update specific components only
   ```bash
   cursor-utils config update
   cursor-utils templates update
   ```

### Environment isolation

Try using a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv cursor_utils_env

# Activate environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source cursor_utils_env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
cursor_utils_env\Scripts\activate

# Install in the virtual environment
pip install cursor-utils
cursor-utils install
```

### Check for environmental factors

Some unknown errors can be caused by system-specific factors:

1. **Environment Variables**: Check for unusual environment variables
   ```bash
   env | grep -i cursor
   env | grep -i python
   ```

2. **System Time**: Ensure your system time is accurate
   ```bash
   date
   ```

3. **Network Configuration**: Check for firewall or proxy issues
   ```bash
   curl -v https://github.com
   curl -v https://pypi.org
   ```
