## Example Error

```
Ã— ERROR: GitHub API error
  Code: github-002
  
  Causes:
  - GitHub API service is unavailable

```

## Common Causes

1. **API Service Issues**: The GitHub API service is experiencing problems or downtime.
2. **Invalid Request**: The request to the GitHub API contains invalid parameters or formatting.
3. **Rate Limiting**: You've hit rate limits for API requests.
4. **Network Issues**: Problems with network connectivity to GitHub's servers.
5. **Response Format**: The API response is unexpected or malformed.
6. **GitHub Changes**: Changes to the GitHub API that are incompatible with Cursor Utils.

## Solutions

### Check GitHub status

Verify if GitHub and its API are experiencing issues:

```bash
curl -s https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/status.json
```

You can also visit the [GitHub Status Page](https://www.githubstatus.com/) to check for reported outages.

### Check your internet connection

Ensure you have a stable internet connection:

```bash
ping api.github.com
curl -I https://api.github.com
```

### Check rate limits

Verify your current GitHub API rate limit status:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN with your actual token
curl -s -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```

### Update Cursor Utils

Make sure you're using the latest version of Cursor Utils:

```bash
cursor-utils update
```

### Run with debug mode

Execute the command with debug mode to get more detailed error information:

```bash
cursor-utils github analyze owner/repo --debug
```

### Try a simpler command

If a complex command is failing, try a simpler one to isolate the issue:

```bash
cursor-utils github user info
```

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Check API request details

Examine the API request that's causing issues:

```bash
# Run with debug and verbose logging
cursor-utils github analyze owner/repo --debug --verbose
```

### Test API endpoint directly

Try accessing the GitHub API endpoint directly:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN with your actual token
curl -v -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo
```

### Check for API changes

Check the [GitHub API Changelog](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/changelog) for recent changes that might affect your usage.

### Check proxy settings

If you're behind a proxy, ensure it's correctly configured:

```bash
# Check proxy environment variables
echo $HTTP_PROXY
echo $HTTPS_PROXY

# Set proxy if needed
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy:port
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy:port
```

## GitHub API Limitations

Be aware of these GitHub API limitations:

- **Rate Limits**: GitHub has different rate limits based on authentication and API endpoints.
- **Pagination**: Large result sets are paginated and may require multiple requests.
- **Payload Size**: There are limits to the size of data you can send in requests.
- **Concurrent Requests**: Too many concurrent requests may be throttled.
- **Preview Features**: Some API features might be in preview and subject to change.

## GitHub API Configuration

You can configure GitHub API settings in your `cursor-utils.yaml` file:

```yaml
github:
  api_version: "2022-11-28"  # API version to use
  accept_header: "application/vnd.github.v3+json"  # Accept header for requests
  timeout: 30  # Timeout in seconds
  retries: 3  # Number of retry attempts
```
