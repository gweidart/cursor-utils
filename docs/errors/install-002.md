## Common Causes

1. **Missing Installation Files**: One or more files required for installation are missing.
2. **Incomplete Download**: The package download might have been interrupted or incomplete.
3. **Incorrect Path Reference**: The installation process is looking for a file in the wrong location.
4. **File Removal**: A required file was accidentally deleted after initial download.
5. **Permission Issues**: The file exists but cannot be accessed due to permission restrictions.

## Solutions

### Verify file existence

Check if the file exists at the expected location:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
ls -la /path/to/expected/file.ext

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\path\to\expected\file.ext -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Re-download the installation package

If you suspect the package is corrupted or incomplete, try downloading it again:

```bash
# Using pip
pip uninstall cursor-utils
pip install cursor-utils

# Using UV (recommended)
uv pip uninstall cursor-utils
uv pip install cursor-utils
```

### Check installation source

If you installed from a specific source like GitHub, ensure the repository is complete:

```bash
# Clone the repository again
git clone https://github.com/gweidart/cursor-utils.git
cd cursor-utils
pip install -e .
```

### Check for custom templates

If you're using custom templates during installation, verify they exist:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
ls -la ~/.cursor-utils/templates/

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-ChildItem -Path "$HOME\.cursor-utils\templates\" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Run with verbose output

Execute the installation with verbose output to see which file is missing:

```bash
cursor-utils install --debug
```
